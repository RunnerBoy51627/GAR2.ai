# GAR2.ai — Goofy AI Realm 2nd

This is a simple GitHub Pages–friendly frontend chat demo that uses the Groq API (user-provided key)
or a demo mode with canned responses.

Features:
- Static files only — works on GitHub Pages.
- User supplies their own Groq API key at first load (stored in browser session).
- Demo mode available (no API calls).
- Safe, kid-friendly system prompt.

Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- characters/goofy.json

**Important**: Do NOT commit your Groq API key to a public repo.

To deploy:
1. Create a repository named `GAR2.ai` (or any name).
2. Push these files to the repo.
3. Enable GitHub Pages from repository settings (source: main branch / root).
